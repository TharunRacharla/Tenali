Creating a custom, offline voice similar to a celebrity requires voice cloning or synthesis techniques, which capture a specific voice’s characteristics and can work offline with the right setup. Here’s a basic outline of how it’s typically done:
	1. Collect Voice Samples:
		○ Gather several hours of high-quality audio recordings of the celebrity or target voice, ideally with varied pitch and intonation.
		○ These samples are used to train a model to reproduce the voice accurately. Using copyrighted voices may have legal restrictions, so be cautious about publicly distributing any cloned voices.
	2. Train a Voice Model:
		○ Use a framework like Tacotron 2 or FastSpeech for the text-to-speech synthesis.
		○ Use WaveGlow or HiFi-GAN as vocoders, which convert the generated spectrograms (intermediate representation of sound) into audio.
		○ These models can be trained with libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
		○ Coqui TTS is a more user-friendly, open-source tool that simplifies voice cloning and includes pre-trained models you can fine-tune for custom voices.
	3. Inference (Synthesizing Speech):
		○ Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate speech from text with the cloned voice.
		○ This setup can be used offline after training, though it may require substantial computing power.
	4. Integrate with pyttsx3:
		○ Once the custom voice model is trained, save the generated audio as .wav files and use pyttsx3 to play them.
		○ Alternatively, replace the pyttsx3 TTS entirely, playing the synthesized audio directly in your application.
Software & Libraries:
	• Coqui TTS: Open-source, offers pretrained voice models and the option to train custom voices.
	• Piper (previously Mozilla TTS): Offline-friendly and capable of high-quality voice synthesis.
